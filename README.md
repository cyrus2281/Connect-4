# Connect-4
THIS CODE IS A DISASTER!

A four-in-line (connect-4) game for windows.
Connect-4 is a two player four-in-line game written all in java.

This game was written as my first application and for a highschool project.
At the time, I didn't really know much about OOP and java conventions. As a result, this code is horrible to read and look at. But surprisingly, it works perfect. So I still decicde to share this horrible code, and maybe someone find what they are looking for here.


Unfortunately, at the time I also were not familliar with rules of copyright. So this application is a scramble of lots of code from Stackoverflow and lots of other websites. Also for the graphics (which are all modifed by me), I do not have the origin source. So please conact me for credits and copyright.
